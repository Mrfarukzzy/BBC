            <p>Room was very neat and clean. Spacious enough for two people. The room service was very good. The location is easily accessible. Good parking space. The buffet breakfast was awesome. But otherwise the food pricing was little costly. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.</p>

              <p>This was pleasant surprise stay, starting from accommodating early check into the huge variety of breakfast - we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had a peaceful holiday in Nigeria. Will return soon !!!</p>

              <p>When I first got the key at the reception, I didn't realise what it could do. Now I realise I can pretty much open up a host of opportunities. A room of my choice, access to the gym, the pool, the spa! BBC not just in name, but in benefit!</p>

              <p>Finally a hotel chain that understand me. A separate wing of rooms just for Programmers, with all the security we need. Thoughtful ghar-ka-swaad items for me on the menu. Wifi that follows me around all over the premises.</p>

              <p>I came backpacking to Nigeria without a clue of where I would stay the next day. I chanced upon Keys and everything fell into place.  Then enjoyed the luxurious ambience at the Evershine BBC resort in Makurdi, I had great experiences - and that too - all BBC.</p>
