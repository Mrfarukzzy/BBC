                <p>     The BBC Hotel opened in 2018 as a destination in its own right. It was to be a place where guests could experience a singular combination of world-class service, palatial splendor, and inviting warmth. Constructed in 2018 under the auspices of Engr. Ichado Umar Faruk, The BBC Hotel has served as a beacon of culture and refinement throughout the region for the better part of a century.</p>

                   <p>      Explore the details that made The Iconic BBC Hotel <span class="tprim">“The Heaven on Earth”.</span></p>
                    
                   <p>      The BBC Hotel has served as a beacon of culture and refinement throughout the region for the better part of a century. In the early part of 2019, after the hotel narrowly escaped demolition, The CEO and his Crew  completed a multimillion-dollar restoration. They spared no expense in restoring its priceless glamour.<p>
                    
                    <p>     The BBC Hotel is a regional landmark and masterpiece of the acclaimed architect Kirtland Cutter. Grand rooms like the Spanish Renaissance lobby or the Hall of Doges, Spokane's oldest and most exquisite ballroom, draw tourists and architectural aficionados alike. Such extraordinary features have helped The Iconic BBC Hotel earn a prized spot on the National Register of Historic Places. During the hotel's renovation in 2019, the hand-painted frescoes, ornate woodwork and European-inspired marble were all meticulously restored, including the genuine gold leaf around the lobby hearth and the year-round lit fireplace – both hallmarks of Davenport hospitality since the hotel opened its doors a century ago.
